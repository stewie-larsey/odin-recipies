                Pesto-stuffed grilled portobellos make for the perfect summer outdoor meal. It stands alone as vegetarian fare if you serve it with fresh fruit (such as watermelon chunks and blueberries); I love it with cedar-plank grilled salmon as well. You will think you've died and gone to heaven.

                    <li>6 portobello mushrooms</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 small shallot, minced</li>
                    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 splash Chardonnay wine, or as desired</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons pesto</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
                    <li>Â½ cup shredded Italian 3-cheese blend</li>
                    
                </ul>

            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Remove stems from mushrooms and finely chop stems.</li>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chopped mushroom stems, shallot, and garlic until softened, about 5 minutes. Pour wine into the skillet; cook and stir mixture using a wooden spoon until liquid is evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Cool mixture to room temperature, about 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                    <li>Brush the olive oil mixture over the top each mushroom and place, top-side up, on a grilling pan. Mix pesto and pine nuts with the mushroom stem mixture together in a bowl; spoon into each mushroom. Sprinkle Italian cheese blend over the filling.</li>
                    <li>Grill mushrooms on the preheated grill until edges are blackened and stuffing is bubbling, about 10 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
