        <h2>Description</h2>
            <body>
                This recipe is a family favorite that was passed down over the generations. Grandma and Pap just ate them plain, with a fork (sometimes dipped in ketchup), but our family likes to top these burgers with cheese and serve on a hamburger bun in a the traditional way. I have also seen these referred to as Kotlety Mielone. These can also be cooked on the grill.

                    <li>¼ teaspoon sea salt</li>
                    <li>2 slices white bread, torn into small pieces</li>
