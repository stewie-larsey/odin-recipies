        <h2>Description</h2>
            <body>
                <p> This recipe is a family favorite that was passed down over the generations. Grandma and Pap just ate them plain, with a fork (sometimes dipped in ketchup), but our family likes to top these burgers with cheese and serve on a hamburger bun in a the traditional way. I have also seen these referred to as Kotlety Mielone. These can also be cooked on the grill.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                    <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
                    <li>½ green pepper, diced</li>

                    <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon sea salt</li>
                    <li>2 slices white bread, torn into small pieces</li>
                    <li>1 serving cooking spray with olive oil</li>
                    
                </ul>

            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix ground beef, onion, green pepper, egg, ketchup, and sea salt together in a bowl; mix in the white bread pieces until evenly distributed. Form the mixture into 4 patties.</li>
                    <li>Spray a large skillet with olive oil cooking spray and set over medium heat. Cook the burgers until well-browned on the bottoms, about 10 minutes; flip the burgers and cook until the meat is no longer pink and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 more minutes.</li>
